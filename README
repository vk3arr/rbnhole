After installation, modify /path/to/rbnhole in each script to point to the 
install path.  In the following instructions, make sure you do the same.

Make sure you have php and MySQL installed.

In order to configure MySQL to take the RBN data and alerts, it is necessary
first to use mysqlrestore to restore db_schema.sql.  You will then need to
create a number of users complete with passwords in order to allow access to
the various components.

The first user is used for pulling spots and alerts from the RBN and from 
SOTAWatch.  It has the following GRANTS in the database:

GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'rbn_spot'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD 'XXXXXXX' |
GRANT INSERT ON `rbn_hole`.* TO 'rbn_spot'@'localhost'
GRANT SELECT ON `rbn_hole`.`ExcludedActivators` TO 'rbn_spot'@'localhost'
GRANT DROP ON `rbn_hole`.`alerts` TO 'rbn_spot'@'localhost'

The second user is used for reading and posting spots to SOTAWatch.  This user
is defined in db_2.inc and has the following GRANTS in the database:

GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'spotter'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD 'XXXXXXX' 
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, EXECUTE ON `rbn_hole`.* TO 'spotter'@'localhost'

Finally, you will need to configure cron to run the scripts at appropriate intervals.

I have the following cron tasks set up:

5 7,19 * * * /path/to/rbnhole/rbn_hole.php >> /path/to/rbnhole/rbn.txt
*/5 * * * * /path/to/rbnhole/fetch_alerts_db.php
*/1 * * * * /path/to/rbnhole/post_spots_db.php >> /path/to/rbnhole/spots.txt
